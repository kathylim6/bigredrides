How our app meets the requirements:
- We have GET routes to get all trips and get a specific user
- We have POST routes to add a rider to a trip and to add a rating to a user
- We have a DELETE route to delete a trip
- We have 3 tables in our database file (Users, Trips, Ratings) - User and Trips have a many-to-many relationship (defined by an association table) and Users and Ratings have a one-to-many relationship
- We are also submitting an API specification that explains each implemented route

Other notes for the graders:
- Our IOS team did not have enough time to implement the ratings feature, but we still wanted to include this since we had already implemented this table within our code. 
- We increased the security of our app through authentication, using session tokens and username/password authentication (following previous lectures and demos on Authentication)
